This repository is dedicated to ChIp-seq analysis 
You can find the final presentation of the projects! 
The idea was to analyse a given Transcription Factors with data taken from ENCODE project. 
We used plenty of command line tools, first and foremost MACS2! 
Here we report only the R code we used to refine the analysis. 

This project was made together with the help of a good friend @paolamaragno ðŸ¥°!
